   cd .\supervised-learning\
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ðŸ“š Projects Overview

### Supervised Learning

Explore various supervised learning algorithms, including:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Predict values or classify outcomes based on nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Trees**: Model decisions based on feature values.
- **Random Forests**: Ensemble method for classification and regression.

Each algorithm is implemented with example datasets.

### Supervised Learning Example (on-ongoing)

- Remaining Useful Life Prediction using supervised learning and deep learning techniques.
