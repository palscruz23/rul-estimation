# Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Turbofan Engines

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using the **PHM08 Prognostics Data Challenge Dataset** provided by NASA. Accurate RUL prediction can enable proactive maintenance, reduce operational costs, and prevent unexpected failures.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The PHM08 dataset includes:

- **218 engine units**: Each representing a unique turbofan engine.
- **21 sensor measurements**: Including fan speed, pressure, temperature, and vibration parameters.
- **Degradation trajectories**: Each engine's data spans from normal operation to failure.
- **Training and test sets**: Provided for model development and evaluation.
